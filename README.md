# Fetch Posts

This is a Python script that fetches posts from a fake online REST API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays them on the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute it from the command line:

`python fetch_posts.py`

The script will make a GET request to the API and print the post ID and title for each post. If the request fails or an error occurs, the script will display an appropriate message.
